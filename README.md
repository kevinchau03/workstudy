# Work Study Research Project
This project involves the design and development of both a web and Android application for an ongoing research study. The apps will feature publicly accessible pages alongside secure, authorized-access pages. Key functionalities include creating and accessing a remote database, as well as displaying real-time data. Students will gain experience in software development for remote data communication and handling real-time data updates.
